# Airbnb-Data-Warehouse-QlikView-Dashboard
This project extends an Airbnb transactional database into a data warehouse–ready model and a QlikView dashboard. The main objective was to transform a normalized relational schema into a fact–dimension (star) schema, eliminate synthetic keys and loops, and create a semantic layer suitable for business intelligence and analytics.
